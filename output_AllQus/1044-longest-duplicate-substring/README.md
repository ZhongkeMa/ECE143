# [Longest Duplicate Substring][title]

## Description

Given a string `S`, consider all _duplicated substrings_ : (contiguous)
substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return **any** duplicated  substring that has the longest possible length.
(If `S` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `""`.)



**Example 1:**
            Input: "banana"    Output: "ana"    

**Example 2:**
            Input: "abcd"    Output: ""    



**Note:**

  1. `2 <= S.length <= 10^5`
  2. `S` consists of lowercase English letters.


**Tags:** Hash Table, Binary Search

**Difficulty:** Hard
