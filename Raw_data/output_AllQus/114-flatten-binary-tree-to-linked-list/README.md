# [Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List][title]

## Description

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:
                1       / \      2   5     / \   \    3   4   6    

The flattened tree should look like:
            1     \      2       \        3         \          4           \            5             \              6
