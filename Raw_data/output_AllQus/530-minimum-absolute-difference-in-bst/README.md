# [Minimum Absolute Difference in BST][title]

## Description

Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum
[absolute difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference)
between values of any two nodes.

**Example:**
            Input:           1        \         3        /       2        Output:    1        Explanation:    The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).    



**Note:** There are at least two nodes in this BST.


**Tags:** Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy
