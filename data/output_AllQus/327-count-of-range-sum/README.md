# [Count of Range Sum][title]

## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in
`[lower, upper]` inclusive.  
Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between
indices `i` and `j` (`i` ≤ `j`), inclusive.

**Note:**  
A naive algorithm of _O_ ( _n_ 2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

**Example:**
            Input: _nums_ = [-2,5,-1], _lower_ = -2, _upper_ = 2,    Output: 3     Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
