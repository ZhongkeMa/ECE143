# [Recover Binary Search Tree][title]

## Description

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

**Example 1:**
            Input: [1,3,null,null,2]            1      /     3      \       2        Output: [3,1,null,null,2]            3      /     1      \       2    

**Example 2:**
            Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]          3     / \    1   4        /      2        Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]          2     / \    1   4        /      3    

**Follow up:**

  * A solution using O( _n_ ) space is pretty straight forward.
  * Could you devise a constant space solution?
