# [Longest Palindromic Subsequence][title]

## Description

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You
may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Example 1:**  
Input:
            "bbbab"    

Output:
            4    

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

**Example 2:**  
Input:
            "cbbd"    

Output:
            2    

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
