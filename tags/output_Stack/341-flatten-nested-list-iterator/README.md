# [Flatten Nested List Iterator][title]

## Description

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be
integers or other lists.

**Example 1:**
            Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]    Output: [1,1,2,1,1]    Explanation: By calling _next_ repeatedly until _hasNext_ returns false,                   the order of elements returned by _next_ should be: [1,1,2,1,1].

**Example 2:**
            Input: [1,[4,[6]]]    Output: [1,4,6]    Explanation: By calling _next_ repeatedly until _hasNext_ returns false,                   the order of elements returned by _next_ should be: [1,4,6].
