# [N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal][title]

## Description

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.
(ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example, given a `3-ary` tree:

We should return its level order traversal:
            [         [1],         [3,2,4],         [5,6]    ]    



**Note:**

  1. The depth of the tree is at most `1000`.
  2. The total number of nodes is at most `5000`.
